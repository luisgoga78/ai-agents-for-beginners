    """
    Note: In the auto function calling process, the model determines it can invoke the 
    `BookTravelPlugin` using the `book_flight` function, supplying the necessary arguments. 
    
    For example:

    "tool_calls": [
        {
            "id": "call_abc123",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "BookTravelPlugin-book_flight",
                "arguments": "{'location': 'New York', 'date': '2025-01-01'}"
            }
        }
    ]

    Since the location and date arguments are required (as defined by the kernel function), if the 
    model lacks either, it will prompt the user to provide them. For instance:

    User: Book me a flight to New York.
    Model: Sure, I'd love to help you book a flight. Could you please specify the date?
    User: I want to travel on January 1, 2025.
    Model: Your flight to New York on January 1, 2025, has been successfully booked. Safe travels!
    """

    print(f"`{response}`")
    # Example AI Model Response: `Your flight to New York on January 1, 2025, has been successfully booked. Safe travels! ‚úàÔ∏èüóΩ`

    # Add the model's response to our chat history context
    chat_history.add_assistant_message(response.content)
